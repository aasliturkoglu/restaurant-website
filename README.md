# restaurant-website
html, css, js


Our group project in the UI course, which is our 2nd year course at Akdeniz University.
We were a group of 4.
The menu and reservation pages were made by me and of course my group mates also helped.

Here I leave a youtube video promoting the site. It has Turkish and English subtitles
